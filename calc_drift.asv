% Main file to run which will provide plot of drift vs. orbit #
mu = 

% Use init_PRO to get initial conditions
x0 = 50; % set x0, will loop through later to see how distances change things
ri = [x0;0;0]; % in LVLH frame, this initialization is arbitrary
rvi = init_PRO(mu, ri);
print('Delta v required: '+ norm(rvu(4:6)));

% Use int_orbit to integrate orbit
